# Resolver to choose a 'specific' stackage snapshot or a compiler version.
# A snapshot resolver dictates the compiler version and the set of packages
# to be used for project dependencies. For example:
#
# resolver: lts-3.5
# resolver: nightly-2015-09-21
# resolver: ghc-7.10.2
#
# The location of a snapshot can be provided as a file or url. Stack assumes
# a snapshot provided as a file might change, whereas a url resource does not.
#
# resolver: ./custom-snapshot.yaml
# resolver: https://example.com/snapshots/2018-01-01.yaml
resolver: lts-23.10
# resolver:
#   url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-snapshots/master/lts/19/30.yaml

# User packages to be built.
# Various formats can be used as shown in the example below.
#
# packages:
# - some-directory
# - https://example.com/foo/bar/baz-0.0.2.tar.gz
#   subdirs:
#   - auto-update
#   - wai
packages:
  - "./my-example-haskell-lib"
  - "./my-example-haskell-app"

# Dependency packages to be pulled from upstream that are not in the resolver.
# These entries can reference officially published versions as well as
# forks / in-progress versions pinned to a git hash. For example:
#
# extra-deps:
# - acme-missiles-0.3
# - git: https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack.git
#   commit: e7b331f14bcffb8367cd58fbfc8b40ec7642100a
extra-deps:

  # example deps from hackage
  - "unagi-streams-0.2.7"
  - "microlens-pro-0.2.0.2"

  # example git dep
  - git: "https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant-cassava"
    commit: "9e27886d7f41023e6aa1429f6f2badf1b3cb5293"

  # example of a GitHub dep without subdirs
  - github: cdepillabout/pretty-simple
    commit: "d8ef1b3c2d913a05515b2d1c4fec0b52d2744434"

  # example of a GitHub dep with multiple subdirs
